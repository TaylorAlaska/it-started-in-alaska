# It Started in Alaska: The First VPSO Memoir Ever Written

This is the first memoir ever written by a Village Public Safety Officer (VPSO) in Alaska. It documents real stories, raw moments, and powerful experiences from one of the most remote law enforcement posts in America.

Written by B. Taylor, this memoir spans 13 years of life across multiple continents. While much of the book takes place in the Aleutian Peninsula—where the author served as a VPSO in Nelson Lagoon—other sections travel through Cambodia and Taiwan, tracing the deeper personal journey of identity, danger, and reflection.

Told with dark humor and unflinching honesty, this work brings readers into a world few have seen: remote villages, law enforcement on the edge, and the internal aftermath that follows.
